Photo: Paul Sancya / AP       Donna Brazile, the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote a scathing tell-all in Politico , accusing Hillary Clinton's campaign of controlling the DNC for her advantage and keeping it on financial "life support."   Why it matters: Brazile is accusing Hillary Clinton and her campaign of "rigging the system" to ensure she would become the party's presidential nominee (not Bernie Sanders). And Brazile argues that it "compromised the party's integrity" during an election in which everyone has since been focused on Russian meddling to help Donald Trump's campaign.  President Trump tweeted in response Thursday night: "Donna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders. Bought and paid for by Crooked H...This is real collusion and dishonesty. Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering - where is our Justice Department?     Keep reading   ... words       What she found: An agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC, specifically a "Joint Fund-Raising Agreement between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund, and Hillary for America." Brazile writes that this agreement allowed Clinton to "control the party's finances, strategy, and all the money raised." It even allowed Clinton's campaign to decide the DNC comms director, and her headquarters in Brooklyn was given authority to make final decisions on all mailings, budgeting, data, staffing and analytics.   When Brazile found out, she called Bernie Sanders to tell him the news. "I urged Bernie to work as hard as he could to bring his supporters into the fold with Hillary, and to campaign with all the heart and hope he could muster," she wrote. "[H]e knew and I knew that the alternative was a person who would put the very future of the country in peril. I knew he heard me. I knew he agreed with me, but I never in my life had felt so tiny and powerless as I did making that call."    The details: Typically, as Brazile notes in her article, the DNC victory fund is for whichever candidate becomes the party's nominee \u2014 but Clinton's campaign was controlling it even before that happened.    Individuals can only make a maximum campaign contribution of $2,700. Those who had maxed out their limit could write another check (for $353,400) specifically to the Hillary Victory Fund. (That broke down to $320,000 for the Victory Fund across 32 states and $33,400 to the DNC.)  Aside from the battleground states, the rest transferred their money to the DNC, which was then transferred to the Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn.  The Wikileaks emails, which were released right around the convention in July, "revealed Hillary's campaign was grabbing money from the state parties for its own purposes, leaving the states with very little to support down-ballot races," per Brazile.    Brazile blames Debbie Wasserman-Schultz , who "had not been the most active chair in fundraising. ... Debbie was not a good manager. She hadn't been very interested in controlling the party," Brazile wrote.     Show less           Politics                     Link copied to clipboard.

Photo: Mark Lennihan / AP      Twitter released a statement Thursday evening saying an employee had "inadvertently deactivated" President Trump's personal twitter account. The removal of Trump's account caused an immediate reaction among Twitter users, until the account reappeared minutes later. "Earlier today @realdonaldtrump's account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee. The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored. We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again."        Technology                     Link copied to clipboard.             Dave Lawler    50 mins ago     Featured  Trump: "I'm very unhappy" Justice Dept. isn't going after Clinton    Photo: Evan Vucci / AP       President Trump was asked about his campaign pledge to lock Hillary Clinton up in an interview with conservative radio host Larry O'Connor on Thursday:  "The saddest thing is that because I'm the President of the United States I'm not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department, I'm not supposed to be involved with the FBI, I'm not supposed to be doing the kinds of things I would love to be doing and I'm very frustrated by it. I look at what's happening with the Justice Department, why aren't they going after Hillary Clinton with her emails and with the dossier and the kind of money ...?"  Why it matters: This is interesting timing for Trump to talk about a desire to bring pressure to bear at the Justice Dept. On this topic and on immigration (below) he is reverting to the kind of polarizing rhetoric we heard from him during the most unscripted moments of the campaign.     Keep reading   ... words      More on Justice Dept.  "... it's very discouraging to me, I'll be honest, I'm very unhappy with it that the Justice Department isn't going\u2014now maybe they are but you know as president, you're not supposed to be involved in that process but hopefully they are doing something and maybe at some point we can all have it out."  On Diversity visas  Trump said he had a meeting with 7 Republican senators about reaching an immigration deal that includes eliminating diversity visas:  "It's just common sense, these countries aren't giving us their finest people. So when they put them in the lottery, if they even do a fair lottery, they probably don't do that they probably just hand us people that they don't want like this character, this animal, this horror show that just came in and did this horrible damage [in New York]...." "We're supposed to take people that the rest of the world doesn't want and we're supposed to say it's a lovely event, it's not going to happen that way anymore with me."  The facts: The diversity visa program has a merit requirement that applicants must have at least a high school education or have worked two years, of the last five, in a job that requires at least two years of training.

Photo: Jordan Strauss / Invision via AP      Eight current and former employees of Kevin Spacey's show "House of Cards" have accused the actor of sexual harassment and, in one case, assault, CNN reports . A former production assistant alleges that Spacey sexually assaulted him during an early season of the show. Other accusers told CNN Spacey's behavior, including inappropriate comments and nonconsensual touching, was "predatory" and caused a "toxic" work environment. Filming for the sixth and final season of "House of Cards" has been suspended since accusations against Spacey came to light on Monday, when BuzzFeed reported actor Anthony Rapp's account of an alleged assault by Spacey when he was 14 years old.

Dave Lawler    1 hr ago     Featured  Americans are feeling safer in their neighborhoods    People walk through lower Manhattan hours after Monday's terrorist attack. Photo: Kathy Willens / AP      30% of Americans say they would feel unsafe walking alone at night within a mile of their homes, according to a Gallup poll , tied for the lowest percentage recorded since the poll was first taken in 1965. From 1972-1993, at least 40% said they'd feel nervous, peaking at 48% in 1982. The number had ranged from 34-38% over the past decade. More results: 41% of Americans fear having their home burglarized when they're not home, and 41% fear having their car stolen or broken into. Those numbers are both down from previous years but remain the highest of all crimes included in the survey. Far fewer respondents fear being a victim of terrorism (30%), being murdered (18%) or being a victim of sexual assault (7%).                       Link copied to clipboard.

Photo: Bebeto Matthews / AP      Gothamist, a culture blog founded in 2003 and its parent company DNAinfo, a local news site founded in 2009 that has subsidiaries around the country, were shut down Thursday, The New York Times reports . DNAinfo owner Joe Ricketts announced that he closed the properties after the entities voted to unionize Thursday with the National Labor Relations Board, which Ricketts said created too great of an economic burden on the businesses. Why it matters: Digital publications and local news sites have been struggling to drive revenue amid Google and Facebook's advertising dominance and reach. The merger of DNAinfo and Gothamist earlier this year was supposed to ease economic strains, but the success of the partnership never fully materialized. DNAinfo provided a lot of local, urban coverage that will be missed.        Technology                     Link copied to clipboard.

Its sales of 46.6 million iPhones last quarter came in about 500,000 units ahead of expectations.  Shares soared in after-hours trading to a new record, changing hands recently at $173.72, up $5.61, or more than 3%.  Why it matters : Going into the earnings report, there were concerns about both iPhone 8 demand and iPhone X supply. Thursday's report should go a long way toward answering those questions.     Keep reading   ... words       Sales were up in every region expect Japan, where business was down from the prior year, though up sequentially. Notably, the company finally saw a much-needed turnaround in Greater China, where sales of $9.8 billion were up 22% from the prior quarter and 12% from a year ago. The company's business has been weak in China for some time, though the company had predicted improvement this quarter.  By the numbers :  Last quarter  Revenue : $52.6 billion (vs $51.2 billion estimated) Per-share earnings $2.02 (vs. $1.87 estimated) iPhones sold . 46.6 million (vs 46.1 million estimated) iPads sold : 10.3 million (vs about 10 million expected) Macs sold : 5.4 million (vs about 5 million expected) Services revenue : $8.5 billion (up from $7.3 billion last quarter and $6.3 billion a year ago)  Current quarter forecast  Revenue : $84 billion to $87 billion (vs expectations of around $83 billion)  Highlights from the earnings conference call (in progress)   Apple Watch unit growth was more than 50% for the third consecutive quarter (though Apple didn't give specific numbers) In Greater China, Apple saw unit growth and market share gains for iPhone, iPad and Mac, with Mac sales and services revenue in China at record levels. Business in emerging markets outside China was up 40 percent, with sales in India double those of a year earlier. Tim Cook said Apple's wearables business (Apple Watch + AirPods, etc) would be a Fortune 400 company by itself. (No. 400 on the Fortune 500 list, Calpine, had revenue of $6.7 billion last year.) Manufacturing of the iPhone X is going well , Cook said; However, he said he can't say when supply will match demand. Cook wouldn't say how the iPhone 8 Plus sales compared to the standard model, but did say that it is off to the fastest start of any Plus model, which he said was a positive surprise. Apple says its music business, which had been in decline, is once again growing thanks to Apple Music. iCloud is growing at double digits and the services business overall is the size of a Fortune 100 business.

Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP       House Republicans unveiled their new tax plan Thursday, and although there will likely be some changes as it moves through Congress, here's who stands to gain and who stands to lose from the current plan. Trump wants to pass the plan through the House by Thanksgiving and through the Senate by late December.     Winners and losers   ... words      Winners     Most Americans who take the standard deduction , since it\u000awould be doubled from to $12,000 for individuals or $24,000 for families. Parents, since the child tax credit and new family credit would be increased (although the employer-provided child care credit would be repealed and dependent exemptions would be nixed). Startup employees , since the tax plan would allow a deferral on taxes for exercised options without a liquid market to sell them. Small business owners , who will see limits for expensing new business equipment raised, and could pay lower rates. Businesses generally , due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate. Owners of pass-through entities , particularly high-earners like hedge fund managers and lawyers, as the plan allows business owners to have more income classified as business income (and taxed at a lower rate), rather than wages. Corporations with business abroad , since they would be able to get a reduced rate at 12% on overseas earnings on liquid assets, per Politico \u2014 although they would face a new 10% foreign minimum tax, which is aimed at companies storing money in offshore tax havens. People with inheritances , since the plan would double the exemption for inheritance taxes and eliminate the tax after 6 years. Wealthy taxpayers , since the plan would repeal of the alternative\u000aminimum tax and doesn't change the carried interest rate , which benefits private equity managers and venture capitalists.

Scott Applewhite / AP       Rep. Lamar Smith is the latest in a series of House Republicans to announce he won't seek reelection next year. Fellow Texan and House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced his exit this Tuesday, bringing the total to 12. There has been just one Democrat to announce a retirement.  Outlier check 1: According to Brookings , the average terms served for retiring members has hovered around 8 over the last 40 years, but dropped to 5 in the 2016 cycle. The average among these 11 Republicans is 9. Outlier check 2: The number to watch for to help determine if this trend is notable is 23. That's the average number of retiring representatives over the last five election cycles. Over that time, there has been more attrition from Republicans than from Democrats. However, the 11-to-1 ratio of retiring Republicans to Democrats is a considerable disparity.     The names   ... words      A look at the 12 departing Republicans...
