Photo: Jacquelyn Martin / AP       House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady outlined a step-by-step process to House Republicans this morning for moving ahead on tax reform.  The goal: For the House and Senate to get a budget resolution done by mid-October, followed by the introduction of a detailed tax reform plan that he'd steer through his committee and then push through the House this fall, according to a person in the room.  Reality check: Republicans still have one big problem. The House and Senate have to reach an agreement on a budget resolution \u2014 which would set the broad outlines for tax reform \u2014 before they can work on a detailed tax reform bill. Yet conservatives like House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows aren't ready to commit to voting for a budget resolution unless they know the tax reform details first. If Republicans can't satisfy them, there's no guarantee they'll get past Step 1.     Keep reading   ... words      Yes, but: Brady says the \u201cBig Six" tax reform negotiators hope to release a consensus tax reform framework the last week of September \u2014 so that could give a better sense of whether the conservatives will get what they need. (The \u201cBig Six" are Brady, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn.)  The sequence, per the Brady briefing:  The consensus framework would be released the week of Sept. 25. The House and Senate would try to approve a final budget resolution by mid-October. Brady would release a \u201cchairman's mark" \u2014 a first draft of the detailed tax reform plan. The Ways and Means Committee would amend it and approve it. Brady would work with the Budget Committee to bring it to the House floor. House vote. Senate vote.     Show less           Politics                     Link copied to clipboard.                 Jonathan Swan    16 mins ago     Featured  Inside President Trump's meeting with Tim Scott    Trump meets with Sen. Tim Scott in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C.. Photo: Shealah Craighead / White House       Sen. Tim Scott, the only African American Republican in the Senate, talked to President Trump today about "diversifying White House staff and the value that brings," said a source with direct knowledge of the meeting.  Scott told Trump that if he had more people on his team like Mary Elizabeth Taylor it'd be a good thing. Taylor, an African-American woman on the White House legislative affairs team, was also in the Oval Office meeting. Trump, the source added, "was very much on board with that. Liked that idea and agreed."  Why this matters: Trump has appointed very few African-Americans to White House roles. One of the only African-Americans in the White House, Omarosa Manigault, has reportedly been marginalized (though by all accounts this has nothing to do with her race and everything to do with her behavior.) Scott hopes Trump might become less racially tone deaf \u2014 and understand the historical weight of his words \u2014 if he has more daily exposure to minorities.     More details   ... words      What happened in the room, per three sources with direct knowledge of the meeting:  Scott met with Trump for more than 30 minutes in the Oval Office and spent most of the meeting advising the president on "what do we do next" after his divisive comments about "both sides" being to blame for the racist carnage in Charlottesville. Scott used his personal story to move Trump, who listened intently. Scott grew up poor in the South, raised by a single mom. Trump didn't go so far as to admit he made a mistake with his Charlottesville response. Trump said, "I understand," after Scott shared his concerns about what he said about the white supremacists. Scott has made clear in his interviews after the meeting that he believes the president took his concerns seriously, and that he has "obviously reflected" on his comments. He noted the fact that they stayed on that single topic \u2014 race relations \u2014 for the entire meeting and didn't divert into other subjects.  Other key points:  Scott pitched the president on his "Investing in Opportunity Act" \u2014 legislation that incentivizes investment in poor neighborhoods. The president told Scott he was interested in learning more about the bill and working with Scott to make it law. Scott echoed the critical comments he made about the president after Charlottesville, explaining why he was troubled by them, and rooting them in the black experience in America \u2014 a history of slavery, grotesque violence and discrimination. Joining Trump and Scott in the Oval were: Vice President Pence; Director of WH Legislative Affairs Marc Short; legislative affairs official Mary Elizabeth Taylor; press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders; and Scott's Chief of Staff Jennifer DeCasper.

Dan Primack    35 mins ago     Featured  FanDuel raising new money from insiders    AP Photo/Kathy Willens      Fantasy sports site FanDuel is in the process of raising between $30 million and $40 million in new financing from existing investors, Axios has learned. The deal would be structured as a convertible note. A FanDuel spokeswoman declined comment. Why now: This fundraising comes two months after FanDuel and DraftKings terminated their merger agreement, due to objections from federal antitrust regulators. New York-based FanDuel had suspended fundraising activities in anticipation of the merger, which had valued each company at $1.2 billion, so this is really just a restart of an old process. Money history: Prior to this round, FanDuel had raised over $400 million in funding from firms like KKR, Google Capital, Shamrock Capital Group, Time Warner Investments and Comcast Ventures.

Shane Savitsky    40 mins ago     Featured  Rice unmasked senior Trump aides over UAE meeting    Susan Rice at the White House in 2016. Photo: Carolyn Kaster / AP      Obama national security advisor Susan Rice told the House Intelligence Committee last week that she unmasked Trump officials in an attempt to discern why they had met with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates when he paid an unannounced visit to New York last December, per CNN .   Her reasoning: The UAE's crown prince didn't tell the Obama administration he'd be visiting the United States \u2014 common protocol for such a visit \u2014 so Rice unmasked the Trump officials involved, whom CNN reported were Michael Flynn, Jared Kushner, and Steve Bannon.  The meeting topic: Two sources told CNN that the New York meeting topics included Iran, Yemen, and the peace process in the Middle East.  What's at issue: Just weeks later, the crown prince was reported to have arranged a meeting between Erik Prince, the founder of private security firm Blackwater the the brother of Betsy DeVos, and a Russian official in the Seychelles to convince Russia to pull back from Iran.

Shane Savitsky    1 hr ago     Featured  Trump blocks Chinese purchase of U.S. semiconductor maker    Evan Vucci / AP      President Trump has blocked a Chinese government-backed equity firm from purchasing Lattice Semiconductor Corp., an American semiconductor manufacturer, citing national security concerns, per Bloomberg .   The risks, according to the White House: "The Chinese government's role in supporting this transaction, the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity to the United States government, and the use of Lattice products by the United States government."  I t's only the fourth time in 25 years that a president has blocked a foreign purchase of an American company.  Why it matters: The move is reflective of the Trump administration's combative position toward China, especially where the economy overlaps with national security.

Photo: Evan Vucci / AP      One quote you need to read from President Trump's meeting with a group of House Republicans and Democrats this afternoon: "But we do want to do something very, very powerfully with respect to Obamacare. It has not worked; the rates are going through the roof. The numbers that you looked at -- no matter where you go, no matter where you look, health care is failing in our country. And we're going to get it changed, and we're going to get it changed fast." What he didn't say: \u201cRepealed." Or \u201creplaced."

AP Photo/Steven Senne      Cars are not the only vehicles joining the race to become autonomous: self-driving boats could be here within three years, AP reports. "[M]arine innovators are building automated ferry boats for Amsterdam canals, cargo ships that can steer themselves through Norwegian fjords and remote-controlled ships to carry containers across the Atlantic and Pacific." They are "outfitted with sensors and self-navigating software and emblazoned with the words 'UNMANNED VESSEL' across its aluminum hull." They'll still need human oversight, just not on board. And AP notes "some of the world's biggest maritime firms have committed to designing ships that won't need any captains or crews." "Militaries have been working on unmanned vessels for decades . But a lot of commercial experimentation is happening in the centuries-old seaports of Scandinavia, where Rolls-Royce demonstrated a remote-controlled tugboat in Copenhagen this year."

Shane Savitsky    3 hrs ago     Featured  Flynn pushed private nuclear deal as national security advisor    Flynn speaks at the 2016 RNC. J. Scott Applewhite / AP      Michael Flynn worked to promote a private plan to build nuclear reactors throughout the Middle East \u2014 that, at one point, involved contributions from Russian companies \u2014 even during his tenure as President Trump's national security advisor, per The Wall Street Journal .   Think back: This story was already in the spotlight today as House Democrats asked Special Counsel Robert Mueller to look into Flynn's failure to disclose trips related to the project on his security clearance renewal forms, claiming Flynn "appeared to break the law."  One step farther: Flynn didn't give up on the project once he assumed a White House position, instead working to arrange meetings between the former military officers behind the project and National Security Council staff.  Why it matters: It's just more bad news for Flynn as he increasingly finds himself at the nexus of Mueller's investigation.        Politics                     Link copied to clipboard.

Photo: Andrew Harnik / AP       Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced his "Medicare for All" bill Wednesday afternoon, alongside a group of 16 cosponsors that includes some of the party's leading contenders for 2020.  The biggest obstacle facing Sanders' proposal is that it would be a big revenue suck. Sanders suggested that "there needs to be vigorous debate" about how to raise revenue to back it, "unlike the Republican leadership in Congress which held no hearings on their disastrous bill" that didn't pass through Congress.     How he'd pay for it      Here's how he might pay for it :  A 7.5% income-based premium paid by employers, which his paper claims will raise $3.9 trillion over 10 years. This would exempt certain small businesses. 4% income-based premium paid by households, which his paper claims will raise $4.2 trillion over 10 years. This would not affect low-income families. Savings from health tax expenditures, which his paper claims will raise $4.2 trillion over 10 years. Make the personal income tax and the estate tax more progressive, including limiting deductions for the wealthy. His paper claims this will raise $1.8 trillion and $249 billion over 10 years, respectively. "Establish a Wealth Tax on the Top 0.1 percent," which his paper claims will raise $1.3 trillion over 10 years. Add a fee on large financial institutions, which his paper claims will raise $117 billion over 10 years.  There are a couple other proposals listed in the paper, which is worth a look over, here . The main idea behind "Medicare for All" : Americans, no matter whether they come from red states or blue states, should have healthcare and shouldn't go broke trying to get it.

Photo: Alex Brandon / AP       Sarah Sanders confirmed Wednesday that President Trump is hosting Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi for dinner tonight, and added that Trump wants to work with "all members of Congress" on tax reform and other legislation if it will help advance his agenda. "This president has done more for bipartisanship in the last 8 days than Obama did in the last 8 years," she said. "I'm basing that on the fact that he's actually willing to sit down with members of the opposite party, something President Obama rarely did."  As for why Trump didn't invite Speaker Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell to the dinner? Sanders said, "You've got the leader of the Republican Party sitting at the table... anybody who thinks the Republican viewpoint isn't being represented is completely misunderstanding that the president is the leader of the Republican Party."     Other highlights   ... words      Other highlights:  On Bernie Sanders' single payer health bill: Sanders called the measure a "horrible idea" noting, "America doesn't support it or Bernie Sanders would be sitting in the Oval Office right now." Resolution from Congress condemning hate groups, such as the KKK, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists: Trump will "absolutely" sign it. On Trump's meeting with Sen. Tim Scott (currently the only black Republican senator): "It was a very productive meeting that both the president and [Scott] wanted to have," said Sanders. She confirmed that they discussed Trump's controversial response to Charlottesville, but mainly focused solutions moving forward, and bringing people together, not about division in the country. Should Comey be prosecuted? Sanders said Comey passing his memos off to his friend "violates federal law" ... "facts of the case are very clear." On ESPN host Jemele Hill calling Trump a white supremacist: Sanders said her comments were "outrageous" and "a fireable offense."

Photo: Carolyn Kaster / AP       The ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the ACLU of Massachusetts sued the Department of Homeland Security in federal court in Massachusetts today over what they claim are unwarranted border searches of laptops and phones.  The complaint cites 11 plaintiffs , a group which includes 10 U.S. citizens and one lawful permanent resident. Each of the plaintiffs had their devices searched while returning to the U.S. from personal or business travel, including from Canada, UAE, and Chile. In one plaintiff's case, Customs and Border Patrol officers reportedly choked him and physically restrained him to obtain his phone. DHS has been holding onto one plaintiff's phone since January.     Keep reading   ... words      "The government must have a warrant based on probable cause to suspect a violation of immigration or customs laws before conducting such searches," per a press release.  There's been "an increase in complaints of abuses" since Trump took office, said Hugh Handeyside, an ACLU Staff Attorney.  The privacy concerns:  The personal information: The complaint filed claims these border searches violate both the First and Fourth amendments, citing the "massive amounts of personal information, including messages to loved ones, private photographs of family members, opinions and expressive material, and sensitive medical, legal, and financial information" contained on phones and laptops. "The Fourth Amendment requires that the government get a warrant before it can search the contents of smartphones and laptops at the border," per ACLU Staff Attorney Esha Bhandari's statement in the press release. The First Amendment: The concern with unwarranted border searches is that "it will have a chilling effect on first amendment rights," Bhandari told reporters on a call Wednesday, meaning Americans might begin to question who they talk to and what they say in fear the government might search devices.  The big picture: The number of border searches in the U.S. has seen a "spike that began at the end of the Obama administration and has continued during the Trump administration," EFF Senior Staff Attorney Adam Schwartz pointed out on the call, citing Customs and Border Control numbers. Those numbers set the U.S. to conduct an estimated 30,000 searches in 2017, more than three times the amount conducted in 2015.  DHS has commented on this issue before (read the acting general counsel's March op-ed here ) although would not comment on pending litigation.
