Photo: KSAT via AP       "Approximately 25 people" are dead and at least 10 others injured after a shooter opened fire inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the county sheriff told NBC . The shooter is dead, following a police chase, and the FBI is on the scene.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted his condolences saying, "Our prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act." President Trump, who is in Japan as part of a 12-day Asia trip, also tweeted , "May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan."     Keep reading   ... words      Sutherland Springs is a small town in South Texas, about 35 miles east of San Antonio. Parishioners present at the First Baptist Church's 11 a.m. service Sunday morning \u2014 when the shooter attacked \u2014 were likely all members of Sutherland Spring's small community of well under 1,000 people. The church's pastor told ABC that his 14-year-old daughter, a "very beautiful, special child," was among those killed.  Helicopters arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting occurred to transport victims to local hospitals. The local community center has been turned into a resource center for families of the victims to wait for information as authorities are still treating the church as an active crime scene.  This was the worst church shooting in U.S. history.  This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

Photo: J. Scott Applewhite / AP       Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross owns part of a shipping company that has lucrative dealings with a company owned in part by Vladimir Putin's son-in-law, per reports from several media outlets.  Why it matters:  Per NBC , Ross "failed to clearly disclose those interests when he was being confirmed for his cabinet position."     Keep reading   ... words      How we know this  Internal documents from Appleby, a law firm based in Bermuda, were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung, a German newspaper. Those documents \u2014 known as the Paradise Papers \u2014 were shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and media partners around the world including the New York Times, the Guardian and the BBC.  The companies  Navigator, a shipping company that Ross's investment firm began buying pieces of in 2011, and took control of with a $110 million investment in 2012, per the Guardian . Navigator signed a 10 year, $226 million deal in 2013 with Sibur, a Russian company, to ship natural gas out of Russia.  The key players  Ross, a billionaire investor, divested many of his holdings before joining the administration, but kept his stake in Navigator. Kirill Shamalov, the son of a close friend of Putin's who married Putin's younger daughter in 2013. He began investing in Sibur in 2011 and was named the firm's deputy chairman in 2012. Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch with close links to Putin who is under U.S. sanctions. He's another top owner of Sibur.  Ross and Russia  Per the NY Times :  " It is perhaps unsurprising that Navigator would have a relationship with a major Russian company during Mr. Ross's tenure. Much like President Trump, whose company sought approval for a hotel project in Moscow as recently as last year, Mr. Ross has long shown an appreciation for the untapped potential of Russian markets when seeking investment opportunities. His involvement there dates at least to the 1990s, when he was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the board of the U.S. Russia Investment Fund, established to promote American business interests in Russia.  "... his firm acquired a German rail car company, VTG, which pursued an expansion strategy in Russia before Mr. Ross sold his stake in 2016. And Mr. Ross led a private bailout of the Bank of Cyprus, long regarded as a favorite financial haven of wealthy Russians, after the worldwide economic crisis crippled the Cypriot banking system."  Ross's response  Per the Guardian:  "Rockas, Ross's press secretary, tried to distance Ross from the Sibur deal with a series of statements that were contradicted by other sources. He said the Navigator-Sibur deal was signed in February 2012, before Ross joined the Navigator board. But Sibur's annual report for that year said the deal was signed in March.  "Rockas said Ross did not join Navigator's board until 31 March 2012. But a press release filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission on 2 March that year said Ross was by then already on the board. In ethics forms filed this year, Ross estimated that his start date had been January 2012.  "Rockas said: "No funds managed by WL Ross & Co ever owned a majority of Navigator shares." But a press release issued by the company in August 2012 was titled "WL Ross Agrees To Acquire Majority Stake In Navigator".  Rockas told the NY Times: "Secretary Ross has never had to seek, nor received, any ethics exemption. And he works closely with Commerce Department ethics officials to ensure the highest ethical standards."     Show less           Politics                     Link copied to clipboard.

Shannon Vavra    3 hrs ago     Featured  First indictments often don't touch the core of an investigation    Paul Manafort accompanied by his lawyers, arrives to at Federal Court, in Washington. Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP       The first indictments are out in Special Counsel Bob Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential collusion by the Trump campaign. The big questions now are how much leverage Mueller has and how far up this could reach.  Big picture: Past special counsel probes and special prosecutor investigations have often remained at the periphery of what the investigation is focused on, or led somewhere other than where the public and the media thought they might. For instance, investigations during the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations never led to charges at the core of the probes.     Keep reading   ... words      Some history  The Valerie Plame investigation  During George W. Bush's administration, Patrick Fitzgerald's investigation into the leak of CIA analyst Valerie Plame's name to the press led to Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis "Scooter" Libby. He was indicted on five counts, including obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and two counts of false statements. Fitzgerald never prosecuted anyone for the crime he was assigned to investigate.  The Whitewater land deal investigation  The independent counsel probe that investigated the Whitewater land deal led to Bill Clinton's extramarital affairs, including his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky (and his eventual impeachment and acquittal). James McDougal was indicted for charges relating to his management of a real estate subsidiary, Susan McDougal, a former business partner of the Clintons, was indicted on charges of criminal contempt and obstruction, and former top Department of Justice official, Webster Hubbell, was indicted over alleged lies to Congress and federal regulators. Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey was named as an unindicted co-conspirator.  Be smart: Steve Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas, told Axios former probes and their indictments comprise "a small enough data set" that it's hard to say whether that will be the case this time around. "I think there's a tendency to assume that the significance of the case is equated\u2026with the importance of the defendant," Vladeck said, warning against focusing too much on Manafort's indictment just because he was so central to the campaign. "I wouldn't sort of assume that\u2026what comes first is predictive of what comes next."

Dave Lawler    3 hrs ago     Featured  What happened to Great Britain?    Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament are bathed in a dull orange sky due to the remnants of Hurricane Orphelia dragging in tropical air and dust from the Sahara. Photo: Frank Augstein / AP       Steven Erlanger, the NY Times' Chief Diplomatic Correspondent and until recently the paper's London Bureau Chief, depicts a country in a "full-blown identity crisis" with a piece headlined , "No one knows what Britain is anymore."  U.K. politics have been dysfunctional to the extreme in recent months \u2014 Erlanger writes, quoting experts, "It is a 'hollowed-out country,' 'ill at ease with itself,' 'deeply provincial,' engaged in a 'controlled suicide' \u2014 but Erlanger contends that the politics of Brexit, May and Corbyn were decades in the making and are more troubling to Europeans even than the rise of Donald Trump .     Keep reading   ... words      Key excerpts  "While much poorer in the 1980s, Britain mattered internationally. Now, with Brexit, it seems to be embracing an introverted irrelevance." "Britain \u2014 renowned for its pragmatism, its common sense, its political stability and its unabashed devotion to small business ('a nation of shopkeepers') \u2014 has become nearly unrecognizable to its European allies." "However politically divided the United States seems now, Europeans have never considered it a touchstone of stability the way they have Britain."  How it happened  "Britain became a service economy, the empire disappeared and people stopped identifying with the Church of England. Then Margaret Thatcher arrived, and with her, [Mark] Leonard said, 'there was a last gasp of this old identity \u2014 an ethnic, exclusively white and backward-looking version of Englishness.'" "However successful, it also excluded an increasingly large number of Britons \u2014 black, Asian and Muslim \u2014 who felt disenfranchised from 'the national story.' Tony Blair and New Labour moved toward more inclusiveness and cosmopolitanism and openness to Europe, too." "But those validated by the old identity then felt like strangers in their own land, Mr. Leonard said. 'Their revenge was Brexit.'"  Why it matters: As Erlanger notes, there's a sense in Europe that if U.K. politics can be capsized by populism, it can happen anywhere. Britain has also long had an outsized position in international affairs, and in recent decades used that position to reinforce the U.S.-led world order. Now, both members of the "Special Relationship" are looking inward at a time when that world order is increasingly under siege.

Mike Allen    6 hrs ago     Featured  Trump's two Americas    AP Photos       Let's pause to soak in how profoundly President Trump has split America, one year after winning office. Much is said/written about the America that dislikes/disapproves of Trump. Not enough is said/written about how Trump molded his party and nearly 40% of the country in his image.     Keep reading   ... words      A Washington Post-ABC News Poll  out this morning provides the bleakest of report cards: 65% of Americans say Trump has accomplished "not much" or "little or nothing." This is up from 56% last spring. 43% give him the lowest possible rating, saying he has accomplished "little or nothing." Trump receives even lower ratings on race: Fewer than 3 in 10 say he has done a good job dealing with race relations, which is 12 points below the 40% who said in January they thought he would handle race issues effectively. Half of all Americans say they believe Trump is biased against black people and slightly more (55%) say he is biased against women. One-third say he is honest and trustworthy. So one year after getting elected: half of Americans think he's a racist and nearly two-thirds think he has accomplished little to nothing. This helps explain how, based on this poll, he wins \u2014 in a landslide \u2014 the race for least popular president one year in since polling began with Truman. WashPost: "He is the only president dating back to Harry S. Truman whose approval rating at this point in his presidency is net negative \u2014 by 22 points. The next worst recorded in that time was Bill Clinton, who had a net positive of 11 points by this time in his presidency."  And yet ... Trump has transformed the core beliefs of the GOP, making it his Republican Party in a way that the establishment didn't expect, even post-inauguration:  Republicans out of politics, or leaving politics, are the only ones publicly criticizing him: the Bushes, lots of Bush 43 staff, Corker, Flake, etc. But Republicans staying in politics are succumbing, even if reluctantly. Ed Gillespie is showing how quickly the metamorphosis unfolds. The former Bush 43 counselor, a textbook establishment Republican, is sounding like Steve Bannon ahead of Tuesday'selection for Virginia governor, warning of " dangerous " immigrants and mocking those who kneel at NFL games. One flier : "You'd never take a knee ... So take a stand on election day" If Gillespie wins, and probably even if he doesn't, he showed how the Trump America First impulse \u2014 laced with plays on racial fears \u2014 is not a bug but a feature of the new Trump GOP. With little effort, Trump has turned Republicans and the Wall Street Journal editorial page into Trumpers on special counsel Bob Mueller in ways unimaginable in the Clinton days. He has magically silenced a law-and-order party as he hectors Justice and the FBI.  Sound smart: The trend lines aren't promising, folks. Trump won't change and elected Rs \u2014 and those who want to be elected Rs \u2014 are morphing into him. On the other side, Democrats see full resistance as the only plausible response. Hard to believe, but we think polarization only intensifies.     Show less           Politics                     Link copied to clipboard.

Why it matters: "Analysts said the goal of the purge went beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed as he pushes an ambitious and controversial reform agenda."

Axios    6 hrs ago     Featured  Sexual harassment allegations hit the restaurant business    Chef Todd English in Vegas in 2013. Photo: Evan Agostini / Invision for Chase Sapphire via AP       "Restaurants have long had a reputation for butt-grabbing antics, but it has rarely been talked about, and accusers' silence was often bought in the form of settlements," the N.Y. Post reports. "But now, with Hollywood heavyweight Weinstein being exposed ... the kitchen timer may finally be going off":  "A few weeks ago, ... Gabrielle Eubank claimed [in a sexual-harassment suit that] chef Todd English and members of his Plaza Hotel Food Hall staff sexually harassed her."     Keep reading   ... words      She alleged "that English \u2014 who has long been dogged by his womanizing behavior out of the kitchen \u2014 gave her unwanted hugs and repeatedly kissed her on the cheek." "The restaurant world was rocked two weeks ago when 'Top Chef' and 'Food Network Challenge' judge John Besh stepped down from his New Orleans-based restaurant group after an eight-month investigation by the Times-Picayune newspaper uncovered a culture where 'vulgar and offensive comments, aggressive unwelcome touching and sexual advances were condoned." "And here in New York City, plenty of ugliness is boiling over, even beyond English's kitchen."  P.S. Worthy of your time ... Elisabeth Donnelly, a writer and editor in New York, wrote a very interesting and detailed piece for BuzzFeed arguing that Matt Damon's slow reaction on the Weinstein revelations was the latest evidence that one of the highest-grossing stars of all time hasn't adapted to the social-media age:  "Damon's optics are faulty and ham-fisted. ... His struggles in the spotlight for the past couple of years are emblematic of how the self-styled good-guy Hollywood liberal has not caught up to the world we live in today." "He's been persistently oblivious regarding the needs and voices of marginalized Hollywood, who can now call him out through the power of a public platform." "It's easy to make mistakes on the internet \u2014 in fact, messing up one day doesn't necessarily make you a villain. It is possible to apologize. It is possible to take action. It's possible to use power in order to give other people opportunities." "At a crucial moment in Hollywood, Damon has the opportunity to use his power to shift the balance for people whose experiences he's largely overlooked and call for meaningful structural changes.

Mike Allen    6 hrs ago     Featured  Donna Brazile bites back    Provided by Donna Brazile       Donna Brazile \u2014 who led the Democratic National Committee during Hillary Clinton's presidential run, and will be out Tuesday with a book, " Hacks ," lambasting the campaign \u2014 sent me this GIF of herself at the 2016 convention when I asked her response to a counterattack by top alumni of the campaign.     The pushback   ... words      Brazile titled it "Private Dancer." The message: She's living her best life now, unabashed by book blowback.  Brazile was responding to an " Open Letter " \u2014 posted on Medium yesterday, and signed by more than 100 alumni of the campaign's Brooklyn headquarters \u2014 portraying her as a traitor: "[W]e are pretty tired of people who were not part of our campaign telling the world what it was like to be on the inside of our campaign and how we felt about it. We loved our candidate and each other."  The letter was signed by campaign chairman John Podesta, campaign manager Robby Mook, Huma Abedin, Nick Merrill, Jennifer Palmieri, Ron Klain, Leslie Dach, Mandy Grunwald, Jim Margolis and scores more.  The letter was provoked by a Washington Post excerpt saying Brazile "details widespread dysfunction and dissension throughout the Democratic Party, including secret deliberations over using her powers as interim DNC chair to initiate the process of removing Clinton and running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) from the ticket after Clinton's Sept. 11, 2016, collapse in New York City."  " Brazile writes that she considered a dozen combinations to replace the nominees and settled on Biden and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.)." She recalls saying on a conference call with Brooklyn officials that she left like a slave: "I'm not Patsey the slave ... Y'all keep whipping me and whipping me and you never give me any money or any way to do my damn job."  The book includes chapters on the Russian hacking (with a timeline as an appendix). Memorable chapter titles include: "Gentlemen, Let's Put Our Dicks on the Table" ... "Bernie, I Found the Cancer but I Won't Kill the Patient" ... and "I Am Not Patsey the Slave."  Be smart: Top Democrats are furious at Brazile for reopening the wounds of 2016 when the party needs to be thinking about 2018 and 2020. Some even worry that the distraction may have endangered the party's candidate in Tuesday's governor's race in Virginia, Ralph Northam.  But Dems took the bait, making her book a bigger deal than it would have been if they had stayed silent.  P.S. Fox will love this ... Brazile's dedication includes a shout-out to Seth Rich , the DNC staffer who was fatally shot in D.C. in July 2016 \u2014 an unsolved case that has provoked right-wing conspiracy theories:  "In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem's finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y'all."     Show less           Politics                     Link copied to clipboard.

A Spanish judge issued an EU arrest warrant for him on charges of rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust.
